- Language: [programming language]
- Purpose: [brief description of what the code should do]
- Include: [specific functions, classes, or features to include]
- Follow style: [any style guidelines to follow]

Please structure the code with appropriate comments and organization.
```

- Installation: [installation instructions]
- Usage: [usage examples]
- API Reference: [API details if applicable]
- License: [license information]

```

## Creating Multiple Related Files

```
Claude, create the following files in my repository [repository-name]:

1. [filename1] with content:
[content for file 1]

2. [filename2] with content:
[content for file 2]

3. [filename3] with content:
[content for file 3]
```

## Creating a File in a Specific Branch

```
Claude, create a new file called [filename] in the branch [branch-name] of my repository [repository-name] with the following content:

[Your content here]
```

## Tips for Effective File Creation

1. Specify the file extension (.js, .py, .md, etc.) to ensure proper formatting
2. For code files, mention the programming language and any style guidelines
3. For documentation, outline the sections you want to include
4. Be clear about the location (repository, branch, directory path)
5. Provide a meaningful commit message describing the purpose of the file

## Example Usage

### Creating a JavaScript Utility File

```
Claude, create a new file called utils.js in my web-app repository with the following requirements:

- Language: JavaScript
- Purpose: Provide utility functions for string and date manipulation
- Include: 
  - A function to format dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
  - A function to capitalize the first letter of each word in a string

- Follow style: ES6 syntax with JSDoc comments

Please structure the code with appropriate organization and error handling.
```

### Creating a README for a Project

```
Claude, create a README.md file in my machine-learning-model repository with the following sections:

- Title: Advanced Image Classification Model
- Overview: A brief description of what the model does and its key features
- Installation: Steps to install dependencies and set up the environment
- Usage: Code examples showing how to train and use the model
- Performance: Information about accuracy and performance metrics
- License: MIT License

Please format the documentation using proper Markdown with headings, code blocks, and lists as appropriate.
