*Documentation for using Claude with GitHub via Model Context Protocol (MCP)*

</div>

## Overview

This repository documents how to use Claude with GitHub via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. This integration allows you to interact with GitHub repositories directly through conversations with Claude, enabling a wide range of code management, documentation, and analysis tasks.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Claude Pro subscription
2. Check that github-mcp-server is installed and configured in your Claude interface
3. Start asking Claude to perform GitHub operations

```
Claude, create a new file called example.md in my repository with the following content: 
[Your content here]
```

For more detailed setup instructions, see the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md).

## 📋 Available Operations

| Category | Operations |
|----------|------------|
| Repository Management | Create, fork, clone repositories |
| File Operations | Read, create, update files |
| Pull Requests | Create, review, merge PRs |
| Issues | Create, update, comment on issues |
| Code Analysis | Review code, suggest improvements |
